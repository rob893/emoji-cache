# Contributing ✍️

## Code Changes 🤔

The rules are simple.

1. Your code must work.
2. You must add unit tests.
3. All identifiers must be emojis. This includes tests.

## Pull Requests 🤔

All code changes must be merged to the main branch by pull request.

Pull request titles and descriptions may contain text but MUST contain at least one emoji.

Thank you for helping make this abomination even more absurd!
